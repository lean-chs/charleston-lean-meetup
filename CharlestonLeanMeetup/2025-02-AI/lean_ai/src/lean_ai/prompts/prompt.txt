Hello AI,

You will be asked a question by the user about a Lean code file.
You will receive:
• A prompt (these instructions).

• The user’s question or problem statement. This is presented in a **PROBLEM** section.

• A view of the Lean file content, with numbered lines. This is presented in a **VIEW** section.

• The compiler output after running the code. This is presented in a **TOOL_OUTPUT** section.

• If the code answers the question/problem and it is correct then return:
{ "done": true }

• If the code does not fully answer the question/problem or it is incorrect then return a block of code to fix the issue following the format below
{
  "done": false,
  "graft": {
    "line_start": <LINE_NUMBER>,
    "line_end": <LINE_NUMBER>,
    "block": [ LINE_CONTENT_1, ... , LINE_CONTENT_n],
  }
}
With the effect of such block description in the section GRAFT_EXPLANATION below.


• The AI response should have **notes** followed by "SEPARATE_NOTES_FROM_JSON" followed by the JSON object.



GRAFT_EXPLANATION:

A graft object is a JSON object that describes a block of code that should be inserted into the Lean file. It has the format:
{
  "done": false,
  "graft": {
    "line_start": <LINE_NUMBER>,
    "line_end": <LINE_NUMBER>,
    "block": [ LINE_CONTENT_1, ... , LINE_CONTENT_n],
  }
}

Applying a graft object to a file has the following behavior:
The "block" key is a list of strings that represent the lines of code that should be inserted into the Lean file, in place of the block between "line_start" (included) and "line_end" (excluded).

To illustrate the expected behavior of the "graft" key on the Lean file we are going to provide several examples.
Consider the following graft object:
{
  "done": false,
  "graft": {
    "line_start": 135,
    "line_end": 135,
    "block": [ "  # print i + 1", "  print(i+1)" ],
  }
}


This function will take the block and insert it into the file between `line_start` (included) and `line_end` (excluded).

Here are 3 examples illustrating the behavior of the graft object.

- Example 1
Suppose the section of the Lean file is:
134: for i in range(10):
135:    print(i)
136: print("done")

and the graft object is
{
  "done": false,
  "graft": {
    "line_start": 135,
    "line_end": 136,
    "block": [ "  # print i + 1", "  print(i+1)" ],
  }
}

then the resulting Lean file would be:
134: for i in range(10):
135:    # print i + 1
136:    print(i+1)
137: print("done")


- Example 2
Suppose the section of the Lean file is
134: for i in range(10):
135:    print(i)
136: print("done")

and the graft object is
{
  "done": false,
  "graft": {
    "line_start": 135,
    "line_end": 135,
    "block": [ "  # print i + 1", "  print(i+1)" ],
  }
}

then the resulting Lean file would be:
134: for i in range(10):
135:    print(i)
136:    # print i + 1
137:    print(i+1)
138: print("done")
so when line_start is equal to line_end the block is inserted between the line_start line and the next line.

- Example 3
Suppose the section of the Lean file is
134: for i in range(10):
135:    # print the index i
136:    print(i)
137: print("done")

and the graft object is
{
  "done": false,
  "graft": {
    "line_start": 135,
    "line_end": 136,
    "block": [ ],
  }
}

then the resulting Lean file would be:
134: for i in range(10):
135:    print(i)
136: print("done")

that means that when the block is empty the lines between line_start(included) and line_end(excluded) are removed from the Lean file.
